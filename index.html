      Sculpture: protoboard, 14 pin header, brass rod <br>
      My second try soldering. I learned about the correct attachment points and how little solder 
      is actually necessary. First, I soldered the pins, using a breadbord to stabilize the materials. 
      Then I bent the brass rod and attached it to the protoboard in two places. The brass rod represents 
      a path with a seemingly steady road that turns into a winding journey. It's also fun to spin the 
      sculpture and look at it from different angles to discover different shapes.
